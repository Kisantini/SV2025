  **Scientfic Visualization** is a multidisciplinary field that focuses on transforming complex scientific data into visual forms that are asier to understand, interpret, and communicate.
  Through the use of computational techniques, visualization helps researchers explore datasets, identify hidden patterns and gain insights that would otherwise remain obscure in numerical form.

  The aim of scientific visualization is not merely to present data attractively, but to **enchuance comprehuension and decision-making** through visual analytics.
  Application span across disciplines such as **climate science**,**medicine**,**engineering**,**data science** and **environmental studies**.

  In this course or module,students will learn to:
  - Select relevant datasets for analysis and visualization.
  - Apply various visualization techniques such as graphs, maps, and 3d models.
  - Interpre visual outputs to support scientific conclusions and policy recommendations.

  By the end of this exercise, sudents should be able to produce **informative, accurate and interactive visualizations** that effectively communicate scientific findings to both expert and non-expert audiences.
